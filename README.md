# Open Fresno website documentation

This repository hosts the **Storybook + Next.js testing environment** for the Open Fresno website. It provides a sandbox
for building, documenting, and testing UI components in isolation before they are integrated into the main site.

> [!NOTE]
> The Open Fresno website repository
> is [github.com/openfresno/openfresno.org](https://github.com/openfresno/openfresno.org).
> The code should be periodically kept up to date with the main repository by manually copy/pasting the `src/` folder.
